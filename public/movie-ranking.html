<h1>Atreyu's Movie Ranking List</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time!</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spies in Disguise</h3>
<p>I love this movie not necessarily for the movie but because it was one of the first movies I watched with my favourite group of friends. It stars <em>Tom Holland</em> and <em>Will Smith</em> who were my favourite actors at the time, and with it being an animated comedy movie it was a great watch!</p>
<h3>IP Man</h3>
<p>I watched this movie when I studied Film in college. I think it was a cinematic masterpeice, the shots, music, frames, imagery, colours... everything was spectacular movie to watch and study.</p>
<h3>Big Hero 6</h3>
<p>I wasn't that young when I watched this movie, I was a teenager, but it feels like the movie of my childhood. I've watched it several times and absolutely love it, the idea that anyone could be a hero if they had the will and commitment was what stuck out to me the most, rather than having inate super powers or a special background, these were regular heros with big brains and a lot of passion who took it upon themselves to solve a problem. It's an inspiring and beautiful movie.</p>
